    "In general terms, we usually divide command line instruction into two parts. In the first part we focus on commands that are used to navigate the file system. In the second, we introduce commands that can be used to interact with files - creatings, reading and writing, deleting, etc. Or as an acronym - CRUD (__c__reate, __r__ead, __u__pdate, __d__elete).\n",
    "\n",
    "We've looked at navigation commands, but before moving into the CRUD commands, we're going to step through an example workflow provided by one of your colleagues which demonstrates the efficiencies that can be gained from command line scripting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow requires us to install two applications, `ncbi-blast` and `wget`. First, we can check to see if they are already installed on our systems using the `-v` or `--version` flag.\n",
